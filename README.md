# -NODE.JS-RMSF
-----

Server application for RMSF project.

Instructions: 
> Developed in node.js (careful with changes), the code is very clean and simple, but some files are not yet used, just there for future development

> Main file and only to look at now is rmsf_server.js, this has the server and api working.

> This github repository is linked to a online application deployer at heroku.com, follow the link: https://rmsf-server.herokuapp.com/ to access the server

> Due to the repo linkage any push to master will update online server, if the update is broken the platform will be broken to, there are no backups.

> Accessing the link you'll see a web page, it's just a nonsense template grabbed from some website.

To use the server locally in your pc just install node.js framework at https://nodejs.org/en/ use LTS (8.10.0) due to compatibility.
